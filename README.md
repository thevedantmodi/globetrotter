## Acknowledgments

- Mike Borsetti: Mike provides a comprehensive GitHub repository at([https://github.com/datasets/airport-codes](https://github.com/mborsetti/airportsdata)). This provided the foundation for the map, the core of our application.
- deck.gl: The deck.gl team (https://deck.gl/) have very powerful WebGL-powered maps. These maps ease of use played a crucial role in allowing me to visualize large datasets like flight paths and airports with ease.
- zod: Zod (https://zod.dev/) for providing a robust and lightweight solution for form validation. This library helped ensure the integrity of user input throughout the application.
- Vlad Nicula: Vlad Nicula ([https://www.youtube.com/@vlad.nicula](https://www.youtube.com/@vlad.nicula)) has very informative resources on zod setup, and React/Typescript development as a whole!
